# django-react-news-app

This was a project for Carolina Code School to make a news
site with full CRUD, with readers able to make an account and
submit content and photos.

User-submitted code is not immediately posted, but is flagged
as Pending until an admit can review and allow the post.

The styling and content are tributes to my training in
journalism and my love of satire.
